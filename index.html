      My Purpose
    </h1>

    <p style="text-indent:25px;">My purpose on my journey to grow bell peppers was to learn something new and apply it to my other skills. Im takeling the productions side of the food system because with so may threats in the world knowing how to create a simple system to feed yourself and others to survive is a skill that could determine if you live or die.</p>

    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p style="text-indent:25px;">My family has always had plants and flowers around the house and having the opportunity to assist and teach them about taking care of plants. </p>

    <p style="text-indent:25px;">The problem is global conflicts potentially effecting our food in our daily lives. Food could become expensive and harder to come across.</p>

    <h2>Project Analysis</h2>

    <p style="text-indent:25px;"> Some strengths of the location of my hydroponic system is that it is in a low foot traffic area and has easy access to work in. A weakness would be the radiator that is next to my system but since it is summer the radiator will not be on. Another weakness is no natural sunlight, my hydroponic system is near a window but has indirect sunlight. I wouldve liked to have a mix of natural sunlight and articifial light.

    <!-- What are the contributing factors to the problem being faced?
Identify strengths and weaknesses of location.
Show us the steps you’ve used to reach your recommendation and implementation.
Required: Your 2D and 3D Farm Design
Required: Your Materials List, What concepts have you learned from Change Food For Good’s Intro to AgTech course apply to your case?

    <h1>Challenges I Faced</h1>
    <p style="text-indent:25px;">Early challenges i faced was beginning to learn the basics on Agriculture and Programming. I had no prior
      experience in either fields so learning both a the same time proved to be a challenge.

      I takled these challenges by taking it one step at a teim and reviewing the modules. Practicing outside of the
      classroom aswell.
