    <h1>Challenges I Faced</h1>
    <p>Early challenges i faced was beginning to learn the basics on Agriculture and Programming. I had no prior
      experience in either fields so learning both a the same time proved to be a challenge.

      I takled these challenges by taking it one step at a teim and reviewing the modules. Practicing outside of the
      classroom aswell.
